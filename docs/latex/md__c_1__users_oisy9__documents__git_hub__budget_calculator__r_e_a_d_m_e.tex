 

Universal budget planner which follows the 50/30/20 budget rule. The 50-\/30-\/20 budget (or rule as sometimes referred to) is a percentage-\/based budgeting concept that emerged in the late nineties. This is a popular budgeting style, because of its simplicity, flexibility and how it can apply to different stages of life. It is based on percentages, not how much you earn, so you can customise it to your own circumstances. 

 

The 50-\/30-\/20 rule puts 50\% your income toward necessities, like housing and bills. 20\% should then go toward financial goals, like paying off debt or saving for retirement. Finally, 30\% of your income can be allocated to wants, like dining or entertainment.



 

The calculator provides summary of spendings and allowances, as well as pie and column charts to visualize spendings for each category.
